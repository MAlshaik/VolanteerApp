# VolanteerApp

The function of this app is to organise listings for diffrent volanteer events in an organized fashion. The app provides login support and leverages a firebase system to organise each users listings in real time.

This app was developed for submission in the congressional app challenge.

Fun fact: This was my first experience creating a flutter mobile app and I loved the experience.

The ability to create a quality front-end and back-end in a relativly short amount of time is a mind blowing experinence. Not only that but the application can be used on all devices IOS, Android, and Web.
