# VolanteerApp

The function of this app is to organise listings for diffrent volanteer events in an organized fashion. The app provides login support and leverages a firebase system to organise each users listings in real time.

This app was developed for submission in the congressional app challenge.

Fun fact: This was my first experience creating a flutter mobile app.
